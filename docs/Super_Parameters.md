# Super-Parameters

There are two super parameters that you need to change.

## For Forward and Reversal

The first is `frame window`. The meaning of  it: if `frame window` is $x$, then the temporal resolution of forward and reversal is $x$ frames. In simple term: smaller, more accurate.

By a rule of thumb, it is recommended that

* `frame window` = 30 for `machine_label.csv`
* `frame window` = 10 for `machine_label_v2.csv`.

## For Roaming

The second is `speed threshold for roaming`. The meaning of  it: if `speed threshold for roaming` is $x$, then frames which has speed (of central part of the worm) lower than it will be labelled as roaming.

By a rule of thumb, it is recommended that

* `speed threshold for roaming` = 0.05 mm/s for crawling worms.
